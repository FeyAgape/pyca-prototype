          You don't need to do a residency test for this person

        <p>Because they're a national of a country in the European Economic Area and are working in the UK they qualify to apply for benefits in the UK regardless of anything in the habitual residency test.</p>
        <p>As long as you've seen evidence that the person is a citizen of an EEA country and is working in the UK you don't need to carry out a full interview.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do next</h2>
          <p>1. Scan the following items:</p>
          <ul class='list list-bullet'>
          <li>the person's passport or id card</li>
          <li>the proof of where they live</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Tell the person they can leave and to check their Universal Credit account for the result of their residency check.</p>
        <p>3. Send the scanned documents to the specialist decision maker in the Stockport hub - <a href="mailto:hrtAlpha@dwp.gsi.gov.uk">hrtAlpha@dwp.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>
