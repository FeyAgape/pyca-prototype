        <p>Go to the jobcentre on the date of your habitual residency interview and bring the following items with you:</p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>your passport or national ID card</li>
          <li>proof of most recent employment (eg recent wage slips, P45 or P60) or an offer of employment if you’ve not started working yet</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>You will then have a short interview about whether you live and intend to stay in the UK. This will cover where you live, when you arrived and details of your daily life, for example your doctor or dentist.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">If you have other family in the UK</h2>
      <p>You’ll be asked questions about your children or any other family you have in the UK. This will include the dates they arrived, the school they go to and the work they do.</p>

      <p>Bring the evidence listed above to your interview.</p>
