        <p>It looks like you don't have the right to apply for benefits yourself but you may still be able to apply because you have family here.</p> 
          <p>You need to bring the following items to a jobcentre to prove your right to live in the UK:</p>
          <ul class='list list-bullet'>
          <li>your passport or identity card</li>
          <li>proof of your most recent employment in the UK (wageslips, P45 or P60)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">Your family information</h2>
          <p>You also need to bring evidence of any of the following that applies to you:</p>
          <ul class='list list-bullet'>
              <li>your partner's nationality, eg passport or identity card</li>
              <li>your partner's work, eg wage slips</li>
              <li>proof of marriage or civil partnership</li>
              <li>details of your other family in the UK, including information about where they work and when they entered the UK</li>
              <li>details of the school your child goes to</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You'll have an extended interview about whether your home is in the UK, and you intend to stay. This will cover where you live and details of your life, for example the name and address of your doctor or dentist and when you entered the UK.</p>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do next</h2>
          <p>Once you have gathered all your evidence or information call 0800 900 1900 to make an appointment at your local jobcentre.</p>
