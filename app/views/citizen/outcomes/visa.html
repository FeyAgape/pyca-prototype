          You should be able to apply for benefits in the UK

        <p>You have the right to apply for benefits in the UK as long as you can prove this.</p>
        <p>
          You need to bring the following items to a jobcentre to prove your right to live in the UK:</p>
          <ul class='list list-bullet'>
          <li>your visa with the stamp or information saying you can apply for benefits (this may say 'recourse to public funds' or similar) </li>
          <li>evidence of where you live</li>
        </ul>
     <p>You'll also have a short interview about whether you live and intend to stay in the UK for the 
            forseeable future. This will cover where you live, when you arrived and details of your daily life, for example your doctor or dentist.</p>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do next</h2>
          <p>Once you have your evidence call 0800 900 1900 to make an appointment at your local jobcentre.</p>
