        <p>Ask the claimant to bring the following evidence to their HRT appointment:</p>

	<div class="panel panel-border-wide">
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>passport, ID card, residence card or BRP </li>
	  <li>proof of where you lived in the last 2 years</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Then copy and paste the evidence list in the claimant’s Universal Credit account journal. Let them know you have done this and that they can refer to it later.</p>
