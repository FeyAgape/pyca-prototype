          You said you're a UK citizen
        </h1>
        <p>This usually means you can apply for benefits, however because you spent some time outside the UK in the last 2 years you have to prove you're currently living in the UK.</p>
        <p>
          You now need to bring the following items to a jobcentre to prove you're living in the UK:</p>
          <ul class='list list-bullet'>
          <li>your passport</li>
          <li>some proof of where you live, eg a rent agreement or mortgage statement dated in the last 3 months</li>
          <li>details of any trips outside the UK that lasted more than 4 weeks</li>
        </ul>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do next</h2>
          <p>Once you have your evidence call 0800 900 1900 to make an appointment at your local jobcentre.</p>
          <p>You'll need to bring your evidence to be photocopied and answer a few questions.</p>
