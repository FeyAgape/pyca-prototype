        You can apply for benefits in the UK
      </h1>

      <p>You said you were a UK citizen which usually means you can apply for benefits. However, when you set up your Universal Credit account you said you spent significant time outside the UK in the last 2 years. This means you need to prove you're currently living in the UK.</p>

      <p>You now need to bring the following items to a jobcentre:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>your passport</li>
        <li>some proof of where you live, eg a rent agreement or mortgage statement dated in the last 3 months</li>
        <li>details of any trips outside the UK that lasted more than 4 weeks</li>
      </ul>
