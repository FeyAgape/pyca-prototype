          You may be able to apply for benefits in the UK
        </h1>
        <p>You don't have the right to apply for benefits in the UK yourself, but you may be able to through your partner.</p>
        <p>
          You need to bring the following items to a jobcentre to prove your right to live in the UK:</p>
          <ul class='list list-bullet'>
          <li>your passport</li>
          <li>proof of employment (wage slip or similar)</li>
          <li>your partner's passport</li>
          <li>proof of your partner's employment (wage slip or similar)</li>
          <li>proof of your marriage or civil partnership</li>
          <li>proof of dates both of you arrived in the country, if not stamped in your passport</li>
        </ul>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">If you have other family in the UK</h2>
            <p>You'll be asked questions about your children or any other family you have in the UK. This will include the dates they arrived, the school they go to and the work they do.</p>
            <p>You won't need to bring evidence of any answers you give, but you may find it handy to have these details to hand.<p>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do next</h2>
          <p>Once you have your evidence call 0800 900 1900 to make an appointment at your local jobcentre.</p>
