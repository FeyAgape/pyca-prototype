          You may be able to apply
        </h1>
        <p>Because you're a citizen of a European Economic Area and you've lived in the 'common travel area' for the last 2 years you may be eligible to apply for benefits in the UK.</p>
        <p>
          You  need to bring the following items to a jobcentre to prove your right to live in the UK:</p>
          <ul class='list list-bullet'>
          <li>your passport or national ID card</li>
          <li>proof of where you lived in the last 2 years</li>
        </ul>
          <p>You will then have a short interview about whether you live and intend to stay in the UK. This will cover where you live, when you arrived and details of your daily life, for example your doctor or dentist.</p>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">If you have other family in the UK</h2>
            <p>You'll be asked questions about your children or any other family you have in the UK. This will include the dates they arrived, the school they go to and the work they do.</p>
            <p>You don't need to bring evidence of any answers you give, but you may find it handy to have these details to hand.<p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do next</h2>
          <p>Once you have your evidence call 0800 900 1900 to make an appointment at your local jobcentre.</p>
