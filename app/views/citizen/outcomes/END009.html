      <p>You have the right to apply for benefits in the UK as long as you can prove this.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do next</h2>

      <div class="panel panel-border-wide">
        <p>Go to the jobcentre on the date of your habitual residency interview and bring the following items with you:</p>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>your visa with the stamp or information saying you can apply for benefits (this may say ‘recourse to public funds’, or similar)</li>
          <li>evidence of where you live</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>You will have a short interview about whether you live and intend to stay in the UK. This will cover where you live, when you arrived and details of your daily life, for example your doctor or dentist.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">If you have other family in the UK</h2>
      <p>You’ll also be asked questions about your children or any other family you have in the UK. This will include the dates they arrived, the school they go to and the work they do.</p>
